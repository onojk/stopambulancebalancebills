    <!-- Common patterns -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Common patterns reported across the United States</h2>
        <p>
          Ambulance balance billing can affect anyone who dials 911. The specific
          circumstances vary, but the underlying issues fall into a few clear categories.
        </p>

        <div class="grid grid-3">
          <article class="card">
            <h3>1. Out-of-network ambulance, in-network hospital</h3>
            <p>
              Many people discover that the ambulance responding to their emergency
              was <strong>out of network</strong>, even when the hospital they were taken to
              was in-network. Dispatch decides which ambulance is sent, not the patient.
              This lack of choice is a core driver of surprise bills.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>2. High charges and large “balance” bills</h3>
            <p>
              Ground ambulance bills commonly fall in the <strong>$1,000–$5,000+</strong> range.
              Insurers may pay only what they consider “reasonable,” leaving a large
              unpaid portion. The ambulance provider then bills the patient for the rest
              — the <strong>balance bill</strong>.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>3. Short trips, long-lasting financial impact</h3>
            <p>
              People report short rides — sometimes under 20 minutes — that turn into
              months or years of financial stress. For many households, a surprise bill
              of several thousand dollars is larger than rent, a mortgage payment,
              or a month of income.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>4. Confusing or incomplete billing information</h3>
            <p>
              Bills often arrive with minimal detail: a total charge, a generic code,
              and little explanation. Many patients do not receive an <strong>itemized bill</strong>
              unless they know to request one, which makes it hard to verify
              what was done and whether the charges are appropriate.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>5. Billing and collections during appeals</h3>
            <p>
              A recurring pattern is ambulance providers continuing to send bills
              — or even sending accounts to collections — while an insurance appeal
              is still pending. This can damage credit and add anxiety even when
              the patient is actively following the proper appeal process.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>6. Lack of awareness about rights and options</h3>
            <p>
              Many people do not realize they can ask for an itemized bill,
              dispute errors, appeal insurance decisions, or file complaints
              with state regulators. As a result, some patients pay bills they
              may not legally owe or that could have been reduced.

      <div class="container">
        <h2>If you’ve received an ambulance bill, here are practical steps</h2>
        <p>
          This is not legal or financial advice, but these are common steps people
          take when they want to understand or challenge an ambulance bill.
        </p>

        <ol class="step-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Collect all paperwork.</strong>
            Save every bill, Explanation of Benefits (EOB), letter, and email from
            both the ambulance provider and your insurer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Request an itemized bill.</strong>
            Ask the ambulance company for a detailed, itemized statement showing
            every charge, code, and date of service.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Confirm network status.</strong>
            Check whether the ambulance provider and receiving hospital were
            in or out of network on the date of service.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Call your insurer.</strong>
            Ask for a clear written explanation of what was paid, what was denied,
            and why. Request information on your appeal rights and deadlines.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>File an appeal if appropriate.</strong>
            Many people are able to get bills reduced or reprocessed by filing
            an internal appeal with their insurer and providing additional
            documentation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Know your state resources.</strong>
            Some states have consumer assistance programs, surprise billing laws,
            or ombuds offices that can review ambulance disputes or help you
            understand your options.
          </li>
        </ol>
