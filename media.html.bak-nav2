    <h2>About Stop Ambulance Balance Bills</h2>
    <p>
        Stop Ambulance Balance Bills is a patient-centered advocacy effort focused on one gap:
        the fact that ground ambulances are often excluded from surprise billing protections.
        We highlight real patient stories, explain how billing works, and provide tools for
        disputing unfair charges and pushing for reform.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project is independent, nonpartisan, and focused on transparency, fairness,
        and reducing financial harm from medical emergencies.
    </p>

    <h2>Quick Facts for Coverage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground ambulance rides are frequently billed as out-of-network, even when the hospital is in-network.</li>
        <li>Patients usually cannot choose which ambulance company responds when they dial 911.</li>
        <li>Balance bills can be hundreds or thousands of dollars, often arriving weeks after the emergency.</li>
        <li>The federal No Surprises Act does <strong>not</strong> fully protect patients from ground ambulance balance bills.</li>
        <li>Many patients are unaware that they can dispute or appeal an ambulance bill.</li>
    </ul>
