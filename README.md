stopambulancebalancebills
A public-interest initiative dedicated to ending “balance billing” for ground ambulances in the United States.
🚑 Overview

stopambulancebalancebills.org is a public-interest advocacy project focused on eliminating the widespread practice of “balance billing” for emergency ground ambulance services in the United States. Millions of patients — even those with health insurance — receive surprise ambulance bills for thousands of dollars after a 911 transport they had no ability to choose or refuse.

This project aims to create awareness, provide public resources, publish data, share real stories, and advocate for legislative action that protects patients from financially devastating emergency medical bills.

When someone calls 911, they should receive help — not a surprise invoice.

💡 What Is Ambulance Balance Billing?

“Balance billing” occurs when:

A ground ambulance service is out-of-network,

The insurer pays only a portion of the provider’s charge,

And the ambulance provider bills the patient for the remaining difference (“the balance”).

Unlike hospitals and air ambulances, ground ambulances were excluded from major federal protections in the No Surprises Act. As a result:

~70% of U.S. ambulance rides are out-of-network

Patients frequently receive charges from $1,000–$5,000+

Many people avoid calling 911 due to fear of financial ruin

Aggressive debt collection practices are common: credit reporting, wage garnishment, liens, etc.

This project exists to stop this.

🎯 Mission Statement

Our mission is to end ambulance balance billing nationally through:

📜 Legislative and policy advocacy

📊 Data publication and research analysis

🧾 Educational resources for patients and families

🧑‍⚖️ Guides for legal rights and dispute processes

🗣️ Story collection from affected individuals

🧰 Tools for activism, petitions, and contacting lawmakers

We believe no one should face financial hardship for receiving emergency medical care they could not realistically refuse or shop for.

🌎 Why This Matters

Emergency medical transportation is not optional.
You cannot “price shop” during a medical crisis.

Yet Americans are being charged:

$2,500 median private ambulance bill

Up to $7,500+ in some cities

1 in 4 rides result in a surprise bill

Low-income, elderly, and vulnerable patients are hit hardest

This is a systemic failure that discourages people from calling 911 — and that puts lives at risk.

📢 Call to Action

The goal of this project is to build a public movement that pressures lawmakers to:

Ban balance billing for all ground ambulances

Require insurers to treat ambulance transport like other emergency services

Protect uninsured patients from excessive charges

Increase transparency for ambulance pricing

Enforce fair, regulated reimbursement structures

Your voice matters. Your story matters.
Together we can end this harmful practice.
