    <h2>Why These Stories Matter</h2>
    <p>
        Behind every ambulance balance bill is a person who called 911 in a moment of crisis.
        No one should have to choose between getting emergency care and going into debt.
        These stories show how common—and how harmful—these bills really are.
    </p>
    <p>
        We share stories to shine a light on the problem, to push for policy change,
        and to remind patients that they are not alone.

    <h2>Patient Experiences (Names Changed for Privacy)</h2>

    <article class="story">
        <h3>“I Did Everything Right and Still Got a Huge Bill”</h3>
        <p>
            After a car accident, Alex was taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital.
            They had insurance, paid their premiums on time, and assumed the ride was covered.
            Weeks later, a bill for thousands of dollars arrived because the ambulance
            provider was out of network. The hospital was covered. The ambulance was not.
        </p>

    <article class="story">
        <h3>“The Bill Was More Than My Rent”</h3>
        <p>
            When Jordan’s child had trouble breathing, calling 911 was the only option.
            The ambulance ride lasted less than 20 minutes. The balance bill that followed
            was higher than a month of rent. Jordan spent hours on the phone with the
            provider and insurer, trying to understand the charges and ask for relief.
        </p>
    </article>

    <article class="story">
        <h3>“I Was Sent to Collections While Appealing”</h3>
        <p>
            Taylor tried to dispute an ambulance bill by filing an appeal with their insurer.
            Even while the appeal was pending, the ambulance company sent the bill to collections.
            The stress of dealing with collection calls added to the trauma of the original emergency.
        </p>
    </article>

    <p class="note">
        These examples reflect common patterns seen across the country. Many patients never speak up,
        and many never learn they can dispute or appeal a bill.
